# type-app

    Personal Project - asiantype

It was a idea my friend came up with. My friend loved monkeytype and he told me if I was able to make one, he said he'll be typing on it everyday. That stuck with me and decided I'd reserve the spring break to make it. I told him "bet I'll make one and it's going to be call asiantype".

To open the app, cd into typing-app, open an terminal and write 

    "yarn start".

App is now online:
